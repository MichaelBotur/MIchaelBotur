## How do you think you did?

Okay - the assignment clearly matched what was being taught in our tutorials

## Did you struggle with any parts of the assignment?

Yes and no... sometimes it's hard to know if the code has to run in VS Code Output before running live

## What would you do differently next time? 

## Was the assignment relevant to the topics covered in the tutorial videos and meetings?
Yes - very closely relevant, Nick did a good job of explaining how destructuring 
## Would you like to add any other feedback?
It isn't immediately obvious how the batman/avengers destructuring practice is used.... Could confuse Kelly.
